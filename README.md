RandomCats
==========

I made this app to thank the awesome coders of [Hackers at Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/) for letting [Mizzou ACM](http://acm.missouri.edu/) adapt their workshop idea.  Thank you, H@B!!!

Made with the Flask Python framework.  Pictures served from Dropbox.

Currently located [here](http://randomcats.herokuapp.com/).
